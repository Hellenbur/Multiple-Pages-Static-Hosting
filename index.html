    <h1>ðŸ¥§Apple crumble</h1>
    <p>
      Apple crumble is a British pudding that originated during World War II
      food rationing. </br>The crumble topping is made of butter, flour, and brown
      sugar rolled together so that it resembles breadcrumbs. </br> Crumbles made from
      apples, and sometimes other fruits, are also common in Australia, New
      Zealand and Ireland.
